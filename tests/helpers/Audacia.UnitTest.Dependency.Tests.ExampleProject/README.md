# Audacia.Dependency.Tests.ExampleProject
This project contains no application code, and acts as an example project with a typical data model for use for the unit tests.

This project includes `IEntityDependencyConfiguration`s for the data model, as well as `EntityDependency` classes for the entities. In practice, these two things would live in the `src` and `test` areas respectively.
